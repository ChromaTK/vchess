h3 Basics

p
	| Orthodox rules apply, with only one change:
	| every time a piece is captured, the capturer "reserve" of waiting pieces is
	| augmented with this figure. At every move, you may choose to land one of your
	| reserve pieces anywhere on the board (except last rank for pawns),
	| instead of playing a regular move.

p.
	Move notation: an arobase '@' indicate piece landing. For example B@d4 means
	a bishop rebirth on d4 square, and @f3 is a pawn landing on f3.

p.
	Note: when a promoted pawn is captured, capturing it put a pawn in the reserve,
	not the promoted piece. This is to allow to gain material on last rank without
	fear of giving a queen to the opponent.
