h3 Specifications

ul
	li Chessboard: standard.
	li Material: standard.
	li Non-capturing moves: standard.
	li Special moves: no castling (and no en-passant).
	li Captures: standard.
	li End of game: standard.

p.
	...(Almost) Only the initial position changes, but this is a very big change.
	In particular, castling would be rather pointless so it's disabled here.
	En-passant captures are impossible because all pawns already reached 7th rank.

h3 Note on initial position

p.
	Since truly random start can allow un-defendable mate in 3 with a knight,
	the kings touch at least one knight in the initial position.
	This allows to move free out of potential check from the very beginning.
	Here is an example:

	figcaption.
		The king cannot take on a8 because it's guarded by the knight: it's checkmate
