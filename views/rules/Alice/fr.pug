	| So there are two boards. All pieces start on board 1.

h3 Basics

p
	| Two boards are used in this variant. Pieces from board 2 are represented on
	| the main board, upside down.
	| Any move played must be valid on the board it is played on.
	| In addition, the final square should not be occupied by a piece from the other board
	| (thus allowing to represent all on one board).

p Notation for Alice pieces was chosen as follow:
ul
	li Pawn : S
	li Rook : U
	li Knight : O
	li Bishop : C
	li Queen : T
	li King : L

h3 End of the game

p
	| As in the orthodox game, win by checkmating the king. It shouldn't be able to
	| escape the check, not even by moving to the other board.

p.
	Note: en-passant and castle occur as they do in the standard game.
	More specifically, en-passant is possible regardless of the worlds pawns are in.
	This is justified because pawns "go through the mirror" while moving, and can
	thus be captured either right after or just before they pass the mirror.
	Castling should be legal according to orthodox rules on the board 1 (it cannot
	occur on board 2, because it would mean king and rook moved). Moreover, the
	king cannot be in check on board 2 after castling.
