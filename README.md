# v[ariant]chess.club

Website to play to many chess variants, including rare ones - some almost
never seen elsewhere, like "l'&Eacute;chiquet&eacute;" [french], renamed "checkered chess"
in english.

Notes:
 - Games start with a random assymetric position!
 - No ratings, no tournaments: no "competition spirit"
