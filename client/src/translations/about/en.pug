h3 History

p.
  This website was born after Patrick Bernier told me about
  a variant he invented: l'Échiqueté ('Checkered' here), which involves
  pieces that both sides can play.
  Back then in 2012, I developed a small website allowing to play this variant
  by correspondance.
  A few years later I had a prototype to play in live, then other variants
  were added and the website was improved to be more attractive.
