  "about_intro1": "This website was born after Patrick Bernier told me about " +
    "a variant he invented, called 'l'Échiqueté', which involves mixed pieces, " +
    "half-black and half-white. Back then in 2012, I developed a small website " +
    "allowing to play by correspondance with this variant only. I already had " +
    "in mind other variants to be added to the website, 'Zen chess' being the " +
    "first on the list because it changed so much the thinking process that I " +
    "was very curious to play it.",
  "about_intro2": "After a long break, a prototype website allowing to play " +
    "live games was tested in the end of 2017, with only a few players. " +
    "One year later the first version of the final website was published: " +
    "it offered three modes, against a human, a computer engine or analyzing, " +
    "with about twenty variants available. The current website is a more modern " +
    "rewriting of this initial version: it now has the basic features expected " +
    "from a chess playing website :)",
  "about_sitemap": "From the main Hall, you can see and talk to online players, " +
    "send and accept challenges (live or correspondance), and also watch current " +
    "games. If this is your first contact with chess variants, you probably should " +
    "start with the 'Variants' page from the top menu: it explains all the rules " +
    "and allows to observe sample games or play against basic bots. Finally, " +
    "at any moment in a game you can click on the FEN string at the bottom to " +
    "analyze the position. Try not to do that in live games ;)",
  "about_contrib": "<a href='https://github.com/yagu0/vchess'>The source code</a> " +
    "is freely available on Github: the main ingredients are Express, Node.js, " +
    "Vue and Webpack. The chosen DBMS is SQLite for now because of its simplicity. " +
    "It can be easily changed if needed later. All contributions are welcome: " +
    "<ul><li>Translations: see client/src/translations/ folder</li> " +
    "<li>Styling: client/src/stylesheets/ and &lt;style&gt; part of .vue " +
    "files in client/src/{components,views}</li> " +
    "<li>Back-end and front-end code: a lot can be improved! Feel free to send " +
    "pull requests :)</li></ul>",
  "about_thanks": "A considerable number of people helped for this website, " +
    "testing, giving ideas, motivating me to achieve this project. Thanks in " +
    "relatively random order to Patrick Bernier, Frédéric Fradet, Olive Martin, " +
    "Bevis Martin, Laurent Nouhaud and Christian Poisson for early testing and " +
    "advices from 2012; to Yovann Gatineau and Anatole Vlachos for their " +
    "enthusiasm about the website; to Jérôme Auclair who told me about the " +
    "Dynamo variant; to Nathalie Merlin and lichess players O42, oceansideview, " +
    "okei and opperwezen who tested " +
    "<a href='https://lichess.org/forum/general-chess-discussion/" +
    "vchessclub--play-chess-variants?page=10'>the 2018/12 version</a>; " +
    "and of course to the websites " +
    "<a href='https://schemingmind.com/'>schemingmind.com</a> and " +
    "<a href='https://www.chessvariants.com/'>chessvariants.com</a> which are " +
    "two great resources about variants. If I forget someone in this list, " +
    "sorry and please tell me!",
