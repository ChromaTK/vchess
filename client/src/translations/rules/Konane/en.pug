  To initiate the game, the first player (black) must remove one of his stones
  either in the upper left or lower right corner, or in the center,
  as marked on the illustration.
  The second player (white) then removes a stone orthogonally adjacent to
  the first removed one, and the game starts.
  To remove a stone at this stage, click it.

  Every move then is necessary a capture of at least one enemy piece.
  Capture by jumping orthogonally over an adjacent stone to land right after
  on an empty square. The intermediate piece is thus removed.
  You may continue capturing, but only in the same direction,
  with the same stone.
