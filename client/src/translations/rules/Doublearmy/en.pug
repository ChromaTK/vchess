p.
  The Commoner (C) at e3 and e6 on the diagram moves like a king,
  but it can be captured as any other piece.

  This variant was suggested by Vincent Rothuis (2020), initially with
  additional kings on e3 and e6 - thus two kings per side.
  I may implement this version as well, but for now I like this one :)
