p.boxed.
  Each capture results in an "explosion" through which all surrounding
  pieces other than pawns are removed from the board.

p.
  When a piece P captures an opponent figure on some square S, all pieces
  sitting on a square reachable by a king move from S are removed, including P
  itself.
  The pawns, however, remain: they have to be taken directly to disappear.

p.
  Suicide is forbidden. Thus a king can touch the opponent king and become
  immune to checks, like on the following diagrams: 1.Rxf5 is impossible.

h3 End of the game

p There are two ways to win, by decreasing strength order:
ol
  li Explode opponent king
  li Checkmate opponent king

p Explosions have priority: a checkmate followed by a king explosion loses.

h3 Balancing

p.
  White has a big advantage in this variant. In order to balance the odds,
  you can select "Balanced" to let white choose any pawn (any color) to
  remove before the game starts.
  The game then continues normally, black playing first.
