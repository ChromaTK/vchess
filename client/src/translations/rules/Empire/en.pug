p.
  Empire Chess is a chess variant designed in 2020 by Couch Tomato, the third
  asymmetric game. This game pits the army of the "Empire" (gold) against the
  original chess army (the "Kingdom", black). The Empire's unique feature is
  that its pieces move like queens but attack differently.

h3 General Rules

ol
  li The Empire (gold) always moves first.
  li The Empire cannot castle.
  li.
    As the Empire's pawns start on the third rank, they do not have the
    option to move two spaces or be captured by en passant. Kingdom pawns
    retain the ability to move two spaces initially and to be captured via
    en passant.
  li Pawns on either side can only promote to a queen.
  li.
    An additional method of victory is available: called campmate.
    Campmate is achieved by moving one's king into the final rank
    without being check.
  li Stalemate and repetition are both losses.
  li.
    Facing kings &mdash; The King and Kaiser (Imperial King) may not face
    each other on a file or rank, similar to Xiangqi.

h3 Imperial Pieces

p.
  There are five new units unique to the Empire: 2 Siege Towers, 2 Eagles,
  2 Cardinals, 1 Duke, and 2 Soldiers. The bottom rank are all stronger than
  their Kingdom counterparts with the exception of the Duke.

ul
  li.
    Kaiser (K) &mdash; The Imperial king is called the Kaiser and has a
    different symbol, but is essentially the same as the Kingdom's King,
    also using the same abbreviation (K) &mdash; the change is purely
    aesthetic and thematic.
  li.
    Soldier (S) &mdash; The Soldiers are the two pawn-like pieces replacing
    the two middle pawns. These act like promoted soldiers in Xiangqi and
    can move one square orthogonally in any direction except backwards.

p.
  The remaining pieces are divergent pieces, pieces that move differently
  than they attack (such as pawns). Imperial pieces all move as queens,
  but attack like their Kingdom counterpart except for the Duke.

ul
  li.
    Siege Tower (T) &mdash; The Siege Tower, or Tower for short, moves like a
    Queen but attacks like a Rook.
  li Eagle (E) &mdash; The Eagle moves like a Queen but attacks like a Knight.
  li.
    Cardinal (C) &mdash; The Cardinal moves like a Queen
    but attacks like a Bishop.
  li Duke (D) &mdash; The Duke moves like a Queen but attacks like a King.
