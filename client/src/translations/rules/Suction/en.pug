  li.
    The king cannot move at all, except by being captured by one of the
    opponent's pieces. There is no castling.
  li Taking a king has no effect besides moving it.

p.
  Pawns don't promote, but instead just stay on the back rank where they
  can't move. A pawn can still re-enter play after this happens,
  by being captured.
