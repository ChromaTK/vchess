p.boxed
  | If a piece is checkmated (as if it was a king), it is captured.

p.
  If a piece is attacked and no orthodox move can prevent its (normal) capture,
  it is considered to be mated and is removed from the board.
  If such an orthodox move exists, it doesn't have to be played
  (it could even be illegal because normal captures are forbidden):
  the piece is not captured.
  Thus, kings and other pieces may remain under check.

p.
  Pieces cannot be taken in the normal way, only by the "mate-capture"
  described above.

p The game ends when a king is "mate-captured".

p.
  Note about moves notation: since captures do not occur on final squares,
  an "X" mark is appended to the move to indicate a capture.
  To keep notation short the potential list of captured squares is not written.

h3 "Suicide" note

p.
  In the current implementation, all pieces except kings can "commit suicide",
  that is to say move or be left on a square where they are mated.
