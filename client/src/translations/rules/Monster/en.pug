  White has only six pawns and the king, but move twice at each turn.

  The white army can appear much too small, but the power to move twice in a
  row shouldn't be underestimated. At each turn white plays two moves
  without any constraint. The goal is to capture the king.

  | The diagram position on the left looks pretty much like a checkmate,
  | but white can take the queen and come back to the h6 square. Finally,
  | white can mate in an unusual way, like the following diagram found 
  a(href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monster_chess") on Wikipedia
  | . There is no way for the black king to avoid being captured since white
  | plays twice (the threat is 2.d7,dxe8).
