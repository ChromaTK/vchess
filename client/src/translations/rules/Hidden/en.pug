p.boxed
  | If a piece captures one of the same kind, both disappear.

// TODO:
  // Due to random 2 ranks: no castling (would reveal too much)
  // To not reveal much, also no en passant

p.
  The defensive power of pawns is thus increased, because they don't fear
  captures (by other pawns).

p.
  Endings are also affected quite a lot, and sometimes new threats occur:
  on the diagram, 3.Bxg7 wins a pawn because 3...Bxg7 would make both
  bishops disappear.
