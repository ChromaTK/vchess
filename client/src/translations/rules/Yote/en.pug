  It seems that the color of pieces starting the game isn't really determined,
  so I decided to start with black stones, as in Go game or Othello.
  The following is mostly copy-paste from Wikipedia:

p.
  The game is played on a 5Ã—6 board, which is empty at the beginning of the
  game. Each player has twelve pieces in hand. Players alternate turns,
  with Black moving first. In a move, a player may either:
ul
  li Place a piece in hand on any empty cell of the board.
  li.
    Move one of their pieces already on the board orthogonally to an empty
    adjacent cell.
  li.
    Capture an opponent's piece if it is orthogonally adjacent to a player's
    piece, by jumping to the empty cell immediately beyond it.
    The captured piece is removed from the board, and the capturing player
    removes another of the opponent's pieces of his choosing from the board.

p.
  The game ends when a player has no stones on the board (after move 1),
  or if he cannot play a move. He loses in both cases.
  If only a low number of pieces remain on the board, captures might be
  impossible and after a sequences of attempts players may agree on a draw.

h4 Notes

p Two consecutive normal moves cannot cancel each other.

p To remove a stone after a capture, simply click on it.
