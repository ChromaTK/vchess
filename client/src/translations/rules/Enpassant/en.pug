p.boxed
  | All pieces can be captured en passant, by any piece.

p More precisely:
ul
  li.
    A piece making a multistep move can be captured by an opponent's piece
    guarding a square on its way; this capture is only possible right after
    the move (same condition as for en passant pawns captures).
  li.
    Even if the capturer gets captured en passant on next turn,
    the initial captured piece does not return to the board.

p This is a generalisation of the pawn en passant capture, which is still possible.

h3 Special moves

ul
  li.
    Knights become knightriders, which may make multi knight-steps in the same direction.
    For example in the standard initial position, the knightrider on g1
    can go to e5 or capture d7 in addition to the knight moves (see diagram below).
  li The king can capture a piece en passant by making a knight move.
