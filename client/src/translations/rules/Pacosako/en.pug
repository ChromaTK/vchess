  | "Capturing" a piece creates an union,
  | which your opponent can still use on his turn.
  | Enter an union to release your piece.

p.
  The variant's name means "Chess of Peace" in Esperanto.
  Paco-Sako was invented by Felix Albers in 2017, and further developped
  also by Rolf Kreibaum and Raimond Fluijt.

h3 Basic rules

p.
  There are no captures in this game: only unions of pieces,
  which are released when replaced by another friendly piece.
  The goal is to create an union with the enemy king.
  I like to think of unions as "pieces dancing together", so both
  terms will be used on this page.

p.
  At each turn, a player chooses either one of his pieces or an union piece;
  let's write this piece A.
ul
  li.
    Case 1: A is a dancing piece. Then, it's only allowed to move
    to a vacant square according to our piece's type.
  li.
    Case 2: A is a standard piece.
    It can then be moved anywhere but on our own (normal) pieces.
    "Capturing" an enemy piece creates an union composed of both pieces.
    "Capturing" an union releases our piece formerly in union,
    which has to be moved immediately by the same player. It can in turn
    release another piece, thus following a chain of unions.

h3 Special moves, additional notes

p.
  "Capturing" an union en passant releases our dancing piece from the
  intermediate square.

p Promotion occur when any pawn (in union or not) reaches its final rank.

p.
  Attacks on the king are ignored in this implementation: you can run
  or remain into "check". So, castling conditions are quite permissive.
  Also, if you form an union with your king but end dancing with the
  other king on the other end of the chain, the game is a draw. 
  span.warning This does not follow (at all) the official rules.

    Left: Bd3(+) can be covered by Right: h6xg5 (releasing the knight), Ne4.

p.
  Canceling an union move is forbidden. For example if a bishop is
  dancing with a queen, and makes the move e5 to g3, the other player cannot
  move it back to e5 just after. This is also non-official.
