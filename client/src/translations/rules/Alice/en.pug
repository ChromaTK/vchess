p.boxed.
  Every move played ends up on another board (the "other side of the mirror").
  There are two boards. All pieces start on board 1.

p.
  Two boards are used in this variant (represented on only one).
  Colored pieces appear at every "normal" pieces moves
  (yellow for white, red for black): they live on
  another board. When moved, they return to the initial board.
  Orthodox rules apply on each board.
  In addition, the final square should not be occupied by a piece from the
  other board (thus allowing to represent all on one board).

p Notation for Alice pieces was chosen as follow:
ul
  li Pawn : S
  li Rook : U
  li Knight : O
  li Bishop : C
  li Queen : T
  li King : L

p.
  As in the orthodox game, win by checkmating the king.
  It shouldn't be able to escape the check, not even by moving to the other
  board.

p.
  En-passant and castle occur as they do in the standard game.
  More specifically, en-passant is possible regardless of the worlds pawns
  are in. This is justified because pawns "go through the mirror" while moving,
  and can thus be captured either right after or just before they pass the
  mirror.
  Castling should be legal according to orthodox rules on the board 1 (it
  cannot occur on board 2, because it would mean king and rook moved).
  Moreover, the king cannot be in check on board 2 after castling.

p.
  Any move played should be legal on the board it is done,
  and result in a legal situation on the other board. For example
  1.Pe4 Pd5 2.Be2!? Sxe4?? 3.Cb5# is checkmate because
  3...Kd7 is not valid on board 1.
