  | In addition to standard moves, a piece can be exchanged
  | with an adjacent friendly unit.

p.
  Instead of a normal move, a piece may be exchanged with an adjacent
  friendly one. Switching can move pawns until rank 1 or final rank.
  In the first case a 2-squares jump is possible, and in the second a
  promotion occurs.
  Switching must involves two different units.
  Switching while the king is under check is not allowed.

p.
  Notation: a switch move is marked by the capital letter 'S' followed by
  the exchanged squares. Example in diagram: Sb8c8.

p.
  Note: to trigger a switch move involving the king, select the non-royal
  piece first (to not interfere with castling).
