p.boxed
  | No captures. Pieces under attack insufficiently defended change color.

p.
  Conversion occurs when the amount of persuasion exceeds the
  amount of support. Pieces persuade and support according to
  their standard attack moves. Opposing pieces persuade, friendly support.

p.
  For example on the following diagram, 1.Nf5 attacks g7.
  Since the bishop is undefended, it turns white. Same for the pawn e7.
  Then, the rook f8 is converted. This allows to convert both the knight
  on d8 and the bishop on g8. Finally, the pawns f7 and h7 are under attack
  and thus also change color.

p.
  The game ends when a king is converted, and no king can be converted
  at the next turn. Note that kings may be exchanged, as on the following
  diagram: 1...g6 would convert back the original black king on e7, but
  1...Nb6 is also possible, turning the white king on a4 into black.

p.
  On this final illustration, no king can be converted at next turn:
  white wins.

p Notes:
ul
  li.
    It is possible for pieces to persuade or support through other
    friendly pieces. For example, rooks and queens in the same orthogonal
    or bishops and queens in the same diagonal.
  li.
    The pawn is forbidden to move through a cell which is overly persuaded
    during its initial two-step move.
  li.
    A king is allowed to move to cells which are being persuaded as
    long as the level of persuasion is not greater than its support.
