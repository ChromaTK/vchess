  | Capture the ball, pass it among your pieces and bring it to the
  | center of the last rank.

p.
  At the beginning, there is a ball in the center of the 9x9 board.
  It doesn't move. The first piece to capture it will then hold the ball.

    Capturing an enemy unit holding the ball both make the piece
    disappear and grab the ball.
  li "Capturing" a friendly unit pass the ball to it.

  The black champion on g2 passes the ball to the black queen on e2.
  Victory is then garanteed by playing a queen move on the first rank.

h3 Source

p.
  A friend and I talked some day (in 2019) about a variant where pieces
  would hit a ball to bring it to the opposite side.
  This version is inspired by these preliminary trials,
  because hitting the ball led to somewhat blocked situations.
