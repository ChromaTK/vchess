Finish rules translation in Spanish + improve existing ones
Design: final touch (gain extra space on top, using space on the right)
Crazyhouse: center reserves, grey if zero available, numbers superimposed
Promotions: increase pieces sizes, better background.
Code: use two spaces instead of tabs, everywhere.
Increase code line length to 100 or more?

Chat button should be more apparent after game ends (color ?)
Reinforce security for problems upload (how ?)
The mode switch between human/computer/friend (+ problem) is a mess
(example: finished computer game, ongoing friend game, reload, friend game is unreachable)

Later:
Let choice of time control, allow correspondance play, several games at the same time
==> need to use indexedDB instead of localStorage. Maybe with Dexie https://dexie.org/
Each user would have a unique identifier stored in the client DB.
Allow to cancel games (if opponent doesn't connect again)
Identity would be browser-based: different games on smartphone, home computer, work computer... (why not ?)
Index might still look the same, and variant page would have another tab "Games"
==> running, and finished (which can be deleted from local memory)
(A true analysis mode could be implemented also, to navigate in completed games --> use a button)
Allow challenging a specific player (by his chosen name)
But keep the random pairings as main playing way + always playing in ZEN mode,
except when accepting an individual challenge.
