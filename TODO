# New variants
Landing pieces from empty board:

Generator variant, called "Matrix" ?
Peces on first rank never move but generate new pieces. Pawn don't generate.
A generator captured and replaced by a similar piece does not generate.
King does not generate. No castling. En passant possible?
Goal is still checkmate.

Take(a)n(d)make : if capture a piece, take its power for the last of the turn and make a move like it.
If a pawn taken: direction of the capturer.

Maxima, Interweave, Roccoco

Synchrone Chess: allow to anticipate en-passant capture as well :)

Dynamo chess
