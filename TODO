# Functionality:
On Game page "mconnect" events =>
  send lastate to them (because they have the game infos) or just "your turn" - if their turn
  remember them to send next "newmove" (or just "it's your turn") later - if not their turn
  (=> listen for "mdisconnect" as well)
From MyGames page: send "mconnect" to all online players (me included: potential multi-tabs)
  When quit, send mdisconnect (relayed by server if no other MyGames tab).
And remove current "notify through newmove" on server in sockets.js

# Images:
Color black wildebeest and camels pieces in white instead of transparent.
Color white grasshoppers as well. Adjust wormholes color and size.
Better "Check3" king images: just horizontal red bars maybe (1 to 3).
Center king image for Knightmate variant.

# Misc:
Saw once a "double challenge" bug, one anonymous and a second one logged
Both were asked a challenge probably, and both challenges added as different ones.
