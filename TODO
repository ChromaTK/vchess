Take(a)n(d)make : if capture a piece, take its power for the last of the turn and make a move like it.
If a pawn taken: direction of the capturer, can capture enemy.

Having captured, a unit must immediately, as part of its move, play a non-capturing move, using ONLY the powers of movement of the captured unit from the capture-square. If no such move is available, the capture is illegal. Promotion by capture occurs only when a pawn arrives on the promotion rank as the result of a Take & Make move. Checks are as in normal chess: after the notional capture of the checked King, the checking unit does not move away from the Kingâ€™s square.
