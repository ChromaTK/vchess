Game.vue: detecter coups invalides ? --> ou au moins le tour : move.mine = true/false

PROBABLY WON'T FIX:
Embedded rules language not updated when language is set (in Analyse, Game and Problems)
If new live game starts in background, "new game" notify OK but not first move.

"FreeBoard", re-using a lot of Board logic, but with SVG (empty) board + SVG (empty) reserves.
Will be used for variants with custom non-rectangular board (Hex, at least)
Or, with other board shapes (see greenchess.net for example)

Merge Orda + Empire + Hoppelpoppel + Newzealand getSlideNJumpMoves() into base_rules.js
=> allow to simplify getPawnMoves in RoyalRace (and some getXMoves in Shatranj)

Option "free placement" in Hidden

#New variants:
Chessplode
Tablut

New stealthbomb mode, explode when capture enemy bomb (always on pawn)

Coin Chess
https://msoworld.com/product/chess-variants/
Background: Unknown inventor
Rules:
Normal rules apply except for the introduction of a coin (or counter)
Black starts by placing the coin on any unoccupied square. Play then continues with players alternating turns as in normal chess.
On their turn, a player makes any legal move but may not move onto the square where the coin has been placed. The player may move over (but not onto), the coin square.
The player ends their turn by leaving the coin where it stands or moving the coin to a different unoccupied square.
The coin can never be placed on an occupied square, and therefore cannot be used to protect a piece from capture
A player wins by checkmating the opponent. Note that the coin can be used to remove escape squares from the king.

Power Sharing
Rules: Two adjacent pieces of the same color can share their movement. Adjacency includes diagonals, sharing ends once pieces are separated, and sharing can be used to check, capture pieces, and promote pawns.
(+ pawns and king ?!)

Non-Prise chess (from list http://www.pathguy.com/chess/chessvar.html)

Discord / littleplotkin:
The idea is that everytime you move a piece, that piece changes in value
each piece transformation has an equally likely chance of happening

Recycle: pions posés sur 1ere rangée !
Teleport: pawns falling on rank 8?!

Followking Rules
The whole army moves when the King does.
When the King makes a move, all pieces of the same color move one square in the same direction (parallel to the King's move.)
If by doing so, any piece moves onto an opposing piece's square, the opposing piece is captured.
If a piece moves off of the board, it is lost.
No castling.
Tip: Having your King next to an opposing piece is not considered check, even if your opponent could capture your King using a whole-army King move. It's up to you to prevent this.
Ed Pegg (1999)

Werewolf Rules
Convert by capturing.
Werewolf moves up to 3 squares as a Queen.
Capturing a werewolf with any piece sacrifices that piece and changes the werewolf to your color, except...
When the capturer is a King, the werewolf is captured normally.
Pawn cannot promote to Werewolf.
H. G. Muller (2015)

Pawnside Rules
Pawns can move sideways one square without capturing.
Pawns can execute the initial double-move as long as they are on their starting rank.
Checkmate to win.
As far as I know, the first appearance of this variant is in the recent paper due to Tomašev, Paquet, Hassabis, and Kramnik, "Assessing Game Balance with AlphaZero: Exploring Alternative Rule Sets in Chess." However, if this is not the case, please let me know.

Golemchess Rules
So nice, you gotta capture twice.
Each side has a Golem (rhino) which moves as a Queen, but only a maximum of two squares in any direction.
The first time it gets captured, the capturer is removed from the board and the Golem becomes a Half-Golem (small rhino) with the same movement.
If a Golem captures a Golem, the captured Golem is destroyed, but the capturer becomes a Half-Golem.
Peter Aronson and Ben Good

Knighthood Rules
Pieces can demote to Knights.
Any non-pawn piece can also move and capture as a Knight, but it becomes a Knight permanently.
King can move as a Knight and becomes a Royal Knight.
A Royal Knight is a Knight that has the obligations of a King to move out of check, and you lose if it is checkmated.
Tip: Remember that it's illegal to move your King or Royal Knight a Knight's move away from any non-pawn piece.
