PROBABLY WON'T FIX:
Embedded rules language not updated when language is set (in Analyse, Game and Problems)
If new live game starts in background, "new game" notify OK but not first move.

NEW VARIANTS:
Squatter Chess: safe on last rank = win
Crossing Chess = win when the king cross half-board
Kingmaker: pawns can promote also into enemy king
--> no king tracking, getCheckSquares + underCheck test all kings

https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/18661/alapo
Alapo is a strategy game. Each player owns twelve abstract pieces, two each of six different kinds. Round pieces move in any of the eight directions on the 6 by 6 board; square pieces move only orthogonally and triangular pieces only diagonally. Large pieces move any distance, small pieces only one field per turn.
Opponent pieces can be eliminated by moving onto their position. The goal is to reach the opponent's base line with one of your pieces without the opponent being able to eliminate your piece in his/her next move.
