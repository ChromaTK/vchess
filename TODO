# Enhancements:
On Game page "mconnect" events =>
  send lastate to them (because they have the game infos) or just "your turn" - if their turn
  remember them to send next "newmove" (or just "it's your turn") later - if not their turn
  (=> listen for "mdisconnect" as well, and gameover, and newgame)
From MyGames page: send "mconnect" to all online players (me included: potential multi-tabs)
  When quit, send mdisconnect (relayed by server if no other MyGames tab).

Rematch button (change colors, re-apply randomness params (which should be saved somehow somewhere))
  --> need a bit more duplicated logic: in Game page, listen for newgame, and add a "launchGame" function
Will need a 'rematch' field in Game on server

Put reserve pieces above and below the board. Center them.
Show count of remaining units as a red digit printed on the piece
(can it reach 10? theoretically yes... but then maybe we can just show "0" ?)
Grey "disabled" style for reserve pieces if none available.

Finir de remplacer AJAX par fetch, puis supprimer le "preflight issue with AJAX get --> return {}"
sur le server : faire une page "index" indiquant "Mise à jour du serveur en cours - un peu de patience".

# New variants
8-pieces https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ8K02Da7Ps&list=PLRyjH8DPuzTBiym6lA0r84P8N0HnTtZyN&index=6&t=0s
https://www.chessvariants.com/rules/8-piece-chess "Eightpieces"

"Capture" Chess (idea of opperwezen, maybe not new): captures are forced,
but the goal is still to checkmate (not lose all material).

Cannibal Chess with forced captures.

Knightrelay: implement "official" version as Knightrelay v1

Antiking: implement v1 (deterministic) https://www.chessvariants.com/diffobjective.dir/anti-king-chess.html

Generator vatiant, called "Matrix" ?
Peces on first rank never move but generate new pieces. Pawn don't generate.
A generator captured and replaced by a similar piece does not generate.
King does not generate. No castling. En passant possible?
Goal is still checkmate.

Take(a)n(d)make : if capture a piece, take its power for the last of the turn and make a move like it.
If a pawn taken: direction of the capturer.

+ Maxima, Interweave, Roccoco, Dynamo, Synchrone

S-chess https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seirawan_chess

"Ball" Chess: 9x9 board, ball on center square. 2 queens ?
To take the ball when it's free you need to capture it.
To take the ball when it's used, u need to take the piece.
Goal: bring ball to final rank.
Possibles passes : soit à une pièce, soit sur une case.
  --> remplace un déplacement de pièce. Par exemple pion a2 passe à cavalier a4 = 1 coup.
  --> selon le mode de déplacement standard (donc tout droit pour les pions)
Pas de notion d'échec ou de mat (?)
Si une pièce est mat elle donne le ballon (?)
