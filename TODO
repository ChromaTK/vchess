Issue: embedded rules language not updated when language is set (in Analyse, Game and Problems)
Also: if new live game starts in background, "new game" notify OK but not first move (not too serious however)

For Teleport, Chakart and Hamilton at least: a piece should be attached to mouse cursor,
waiting for a click dropping it somewhere. In BaseGame: find the appropriate place to call eg. Board::setHoverPiece(),
which should be in effect when hovering over position only (#gamePosition), and cancelled when receiving the
message stopHover() for example.

--> Can a stunned piece capture? Maybe not. ...recover? After 5 moves? Never?
