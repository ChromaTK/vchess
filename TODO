newmove received on mygames page should be added to storage if gtype == "live"
and, on game page "mconnect" events => send newmove to them (better than current setup)
also, mygames page should ask lastate infos to connected players if any (where it's not my turn)
(maybe in component GameList, if g.type == "live" ...)
