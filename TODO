Full detection of repeated positions (including turn)
In UltimaChess, consider these rules modifications: http://www.inference.org.uk/mackay/ultima/ultima.html
Reintroduce isAttackedBy in Ultima, and fix it for pawns --> underCheck + stalemate
--> take into account that an immobilized piece does not give check.
(chameleons cannot be immobilized)
